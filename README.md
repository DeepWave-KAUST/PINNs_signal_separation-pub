Reproducible material for **Slope assisted ground roll removal and seismic signal separation with Physics Informed Neural Networks - Brandolin F., Ravasi M., Alkhalifah  T.**


## Project structure
This repository is organized as follows:

* :open_file_folder: **signal_sep_pinns**: python library containing routines for "PINNslope" seismic data interpolation and local slope estimation with physics informed neural networks;
* :open_file_folder: **data**: folder containing input data and results;
* :open_file_folder: **notebooks**: set of jupyter notebooks reproducing the experiments in the paper (see below for more details);
* :open_file_folder: **asset**: folder containing logo;

## Notebooks
The following notebooks are provided:

- :orange_book: ``ground_roll.ipynb`` : reproduces the ground roll removal numerical examples.
- :orange_book: ``interp_and_deb.ipynb`` : reproduces the interpolation and deblending numerical examples.
- :orange_book: ``slope_comparison.ipynb`` : compares the slope estimate of different slope estimation algorithms (PINNslope, Structure tensor, PWD) against the analytical solution.
- :orange_book: ``visualization_ground_roll.ipynb`` : reproduces the Figures of the paper for the ground roll removal numerical examples.  
- :orange_book: ``visualization_interp_and_deb.ipynb`` : reproduces the Figures of the paper for the interpolation and deblending numerical examples.  


## Getting started
To ensure reproducibility of the results, we suggest using the `environment.yml` file when creating an environment.

Simply run:
```
./install_env.sh
```
It will take some time, if at the end you see the word `Done!` on your terminal you are ready to go. Activate the environment by typing:
```
conda activate envsspinn
```

After that you can simply install your package:
```
pip install .
```
or in developer mode:
```
pip install -e .
```

**Disclaimer:** All experiments have been carried on a Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.10GHz equipped with a single NVIDIA GEForce RTX 3090 GPU. Different environment 
configurations may be required for different combinations of workstation and GPU.
